# flow_backend
A lightweight and modular FastAPI backend used for managing Todo items.   This backend is built while learning Python and FastAPI from scratch.   It includes CRUD operations, clean folder structure, Pydantic models, routing, and future support for database integration (SQLite).   This will act as the backend service for the Flow mobile app.
